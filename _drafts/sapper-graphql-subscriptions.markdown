I recently started a new hobby project, and so I decided to take a quick
look at the technologies that were available.

[Svelte 3.0][svelte] was recently [released][released], and it looks pretty
interesting. It has support for Server Side Rendering (for the SEO magic)
via a package called [Sapper][sapper].

I've been wanting to explore [GraphQL][graphql], and this seemed like a 
good opportunity. Real time updates are important for this project, so
I wanted to try GraphQL subscriptions.
