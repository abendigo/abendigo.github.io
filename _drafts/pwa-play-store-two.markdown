title: PWAs and the Google Play Store (part 2)

In [part 1][play-store-part-one], I took the [SVGOMG pwa][svgomg], and released it 
to the Play Store. Exciting, but not very useful. In this post, I am going to 
take a different PWA, and release it.

I chose the [Polymer Project][polymer-project] [PWA Starter Kit][pwa-starter-kit].
I also needed a place to deploy it. The starter kit docs had a page titled
[Building and deploying][build-deploy], and a section for 
[static hosting][static-hosting]. It listed 3 opotions, App Engine, 
Firebase Hosting, and Netlify. As I had never used Netlify before, I decided to 
try it.
