Recently, I read an article, [Google Play Store now open for Progressive Web Apps][pwa-play-store]. This got me
very excited, as the number one argument I hear against Web Apps, is "People look for apps in the App Store".
I decided to see how easy it is. I am writing this entry as I go thruogh the steps, so hopefully I'll capture
all the steps, pains, etc.

Step one, decide which PWA I want to publish. To keep it simple, I am going to use the 
[Polymer Project][polymer-project] [PWA Starter Kit][starter-kit].

Step two, download [Android Studio][studio].
